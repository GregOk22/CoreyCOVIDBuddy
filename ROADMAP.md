## Corey: COVID Buddy will soon:
- Allow users to voice or video chat with local medical providers
- Have data scientists analyzing conversation data to find correlations between symptom severity progression/regression and COVID-19. These findings will be used to aid in the development of new treatments and vaccines

## In the future, Corey can be slightly altered to:

Corey: COVID Buddy currently helps with the coronavirus pandemic, but its code can be slightly altered to help with other diseases, viruses and pandemics in the future. Corey’s chat dialog information can easily be updated through it’s IBM Watson Assistant instance in the IBM Cloud. This means that self-assessments and information pertaining to other health conditions, diseases, viruses, or pandemics can be added to Corey at any time.

With the rise of COVID-19 cases worldwide, Corey is aiding in the development of treatments and vaccines through data collection and analysis.

Corey: COVID Buddy is a powerful mobile “assistant” application that utilizes IBM Watson to have friendly conversations with users. Through these conversations, Corey conducts coronavirus self-assessments, tracks symptom severity data, creates anxiety reduction strategies based on the conversation, and provides answers, personalized tips, and recommendations relating to COVID-19. Relevant extracted conversation data is stored in a cloud database and used to generate symptom severity reports that can be emailed to the user and shared with their medical provider. This conversation data is further analyzed and used to find correlations between symptom severity progression/regression and COVID-19. These findings can be used to aid in the development of new treatments, vaccines, and cures.
